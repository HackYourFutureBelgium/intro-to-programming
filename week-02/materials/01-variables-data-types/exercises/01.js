📚 JavaScript Variables – Exercises

These exercises are designed to help you practice how variables work in JavaScript.
Follow the instructions in the comments, write your code, and run it to see the output.

// 🟢 Exercise 1: Create and log a variable
// 1. Create a variable named studentName and assign your name to it
// 2. Print a welcome message using that variable

// ✍️ Your code here:

// 🟢 Exercise 2: Update a variable
// 1. Create a variable named score and set it to 0
// 2. Then update it to 100
// 3. Print both the original and updated score

// ✍️ Your code here:

// 🟢 Exercise 3: Use const for a fixed value
// 1. Create a constant named courseName and assign it a value
// 2. Try to change the value (this should cause an error - do not remove the error, observe it)

// ✍️ Your code here:

// 🟢 Exercise 4: Use variables to avoid repetition
// 1. Create a variable called movieTitle and assign it any movie name
// 2. Print a message like "Now playing: [movieTitle]" three times using the variable

// ✍️ Your code here:

// 🟢 Exercise 5: What happens if you redeclare a variable?
// 1. Create a variable using `let`, then try declaring it again (should give an error)
// 2. Do the same using `var` (you'll see that it allows redeclaration)

// ✍️ Your code here:

// 🟢 Exercise 6: Real-life example
// 1. Create a variable called temperature and set it to 22
// 2. Then imagine the temperature changed to 28, update it
// 3. Print: "The current temperature is [temperature] degrees."

// ✍️ Your code here:

/*
✅ Bonus Challenge:
Write a short program that does the following:
- Creates a variable userAge
- Creates another variable called nextYearAge
- Sets nextYearAge to one more than userAge
- Prints: "Next year, you will be [nextYearAge] years old."

Try it below!
*/

// ✍️ Your code here:

/*
✅ After finishing:
- Save your file.
- Run it with: `node  ./materials/01-variables-data-types/exercises/02.js`
- Read all console outputs and make sure everything makes sense.

Great work! Understanding variables is the first step to mastering programming.
