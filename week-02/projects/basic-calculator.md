## ðŸ›  Features to Build

Your calculator should:

## ðŸ’¡ Suggested Flow

1. Ask the user to enter the first number
2. Ask the user to choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
3. Ask for the second number
4. Calculate and display the result

You can use `prompt()` to get input and `alert()` or `console.log()` to display results.
