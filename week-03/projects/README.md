# ðŸ“– Week 3: DOM & API Integration

Welcome to Week 3! This week weâ€™ll level up by combining your JavaScript skills with real data from external APIs.  
Youâ€™ll learn how to build interactive web pages using **DOM manipulation** and **the Fetch API**.

By the end of the week, you'll create a book search app that uses a real-world API to fetch and display book data!

## Topics Covered

- [DOM Events & Forms](./materials/01-dom-events-forms/)
- [Keyboard & Input Handling](./materials/02-keyboard-input/)
- [Form Validation](./materials/03-form-validation/)
- [Promises & Async/Await](./materials/04-promises-async/)
- [Fetch API](./materials/05-fetch-api/)
- [Practical APIs (Books, Movies, Music)](./materials/06-practical-apis/)

Each folder contains examples, step-by-step explanations, and exercises to help reinforce the concepts.

## Goals

âœ… Handle events like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard input  
âœ… Validate user input before processing it  
âœ… Fetch data using APIs and display it on the page  
âœ… Use async/await to work with asynchronous code  
âœ… Build a fully functional mini web app

Letâ€™s bring your websites to life with interactivity and real-time data! ðŸš€

## Resources

- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using) â€“ for real book data
- [JavaScript.info â€“ Promises](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)
- [MDN Web Docs â€“ Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

## Project

### Book Search

- [ðŸ“š template](https://github.com/intro-to-programming-2025-1/js-api-template)
- use this api : `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title=go`
- [demo](https://gritchin-artur.github.io/books-api/)

You'll build a book search app where users can type a book name, search it, and view results fetched from the Google Books API.  
This is your first mini-project using the full power of JavaScript, DOM, and APIs!
